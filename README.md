## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an AI student with a growing interest in **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and **AI-powered applications**.  
Currently, I’m working on understanding how modern AI systems are designed — not just using models, but **thinking in terms of prompts, pipelines, and real-world use cases**.

I prefer **practical learning over theory-heavy fluff** and aim to build skills that are actually useful in industry.

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt Engineering (structure, control, evaluation)
- LangChain fundamentals
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Python for AI & automation
- Exploring AI workflows and automation (early stage)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools**
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- Google Colab

**AI / ML**
- OpenAI APIs
- Hugging Face (models & ecosystem)
- LangChain (learning in depth)
- Prompt Engineering techniques

---

## 📌 Projects & Practice

Most of my work currently focuses on:
- AI experiments
- Prompt engineering practice
- Learning-based projects (GenAI & RAG)

> I believe in building skills first, polishing portfolios second.  
> More structured projects coming soon.
